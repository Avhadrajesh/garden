# **How to use this space correctly**

This uses a modified PARA System based on my needs (to have a personal and work PKM that is easy to use and it's not over complicated)

For this reason remember that

- Areas are any kind of project that doesn't have any due date

Explore the various objects, relations and types and remember that for

The following objects

- Projects
- Areas
- Tasks
- Wiki

To link the new object you've created, you'll need to configure the filter accordingly. For example, if you create a new project that requires related tasks, follow these steps before creating the tasks:

1. Complete the filter for "Has Any Of" links.
2. Add the newly created project to this filter.

This way, you'll ensure that you can view only the tasks related to that specific project.

On the Widget side (to the left) i just have a link to

- Para (A collection)
- Resources (A collection)
