## *What is docker Container?*
In simple terms, a Docker container is like a compact box that holds everything your software needs to run. Docker container wraps your software and all the stuff it relies on, like libraries and settings. This means you don’t need to worry about installing or configuring these things separately. These containers are super versatile and can run on any computer or cloud service without any issues.

Imagine it as a lunchbox – it has your sandwich, fruits, and a drink neatly packed. You can open it up and enjoy your meal anywhere you like, whether it’s in the park or at your desk. Docker containers work similarly but for software.
