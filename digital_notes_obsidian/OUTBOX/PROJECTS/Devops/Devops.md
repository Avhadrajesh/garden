- DevOps is a software development strategy that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations teams to achieve continuous automation across the software development lifecycle.
- DevOps is a software development approach that bridges Development and Operations teams through automation and collaboration. It implements continuous practices across the entire software lifecycle:
  
  Development: Teams continuously write and commit code using IDEs and version control
  Integration: Automated building, testing and merging of code changes
  Testing: Automated testing across environments
  Delivery/Deployment: Automated releases to production (with or without manual approvals)
  Monitoring: Automated infrastructure and application monitoring
  
  Key benefits:
- Faster development and deployment
- Improved code quality and stability
- Reduced manual work through automation
- Better team collaboration
- Continuous feedback and improvement
  
  DevOps works best with microservices architecture, where components can be developed and deployed independently. The lifecycle is powered by tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and monitoring solutions.
